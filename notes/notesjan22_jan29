starting to code the financial indicators processing
Things to remember for the MACD
    When the MACD shows a value greater than 0, it means that the market is upward trending, and when it is less than 0, downward trending. Often, this is used in conjunction with a nine day EMA of the MACD called the ‘signal’ to better help indicate upward/downward trends and ideal exit times (18).
    Equation for MACD and EMA
        EMA(t,N) = ClosePrice(t)2N+1+EMA(t-1)(1-2N+1)
        MACD(t) = EMA(t, 12) - EMA(t, 26)
Things to remember for A/D Line
    If the A/D line is seen to be rising/falling with the price it is a confirmation of a trend in its respective direction, where steeper gradients indicate stronger affirmations, while conflicting directions of the price and A/D line are signs of potential reversals in trends (19)
    equation for AD Line
        MFM(t) = (ClosePrice(t)-DayLow(t))-(DayHigh(t)-ClosePrice(t))DayHigh(t)-DayLow(t)
        MFV(t) = MFM(t)TradeVolume(t)
        A/D(t) = A/D(t-1)+MFV(t)
Things to remember for ATR
    stock's volatility is large, so is it’s ATR, meaning it has the potential to bounce back even with a sudden price drop. The reverse is also true with a low ATR suggesting the movement of the stock will continue with its current trend. The ATR is usually calculated over a 14 day period using the following equations, where t is the current day (20).
    ATR Equations
        TR(t) = Max[(DayHigh-DayLow), Abs(DayHigh-ClosePrice), Abs(DayLow-ClosePrice)]
        ATR(t) =114i=013TR(t-i)


Goal of this semester before finals is have everything but the model finished. ie word embedding, cleaning and fin processing done.
    Currently cleaning is done, fin in progress, embedding tbd.
    Fin straight foward cleaning too both done soon
    Embedding I think lets do a dual approach?
        we do the tf idf, dont assign words value before hand
        as well as the model that uses the market finance data Wilshire 5000 to assign values to tf idk word vectors?
            How would i do this..... each day get a vector and train it w/ simple wilshire open close then that feeds into
            NN that then feeds into other NN??
            Its a little un needed like if we just had a large enough NN model and just fed it the wilshire data, essentially
            same thing
            Also for the wilshire data we feed do we want to do finance indicators on that too or just HiLoCl

Need to run the news cleaning for all the data at some point, finished coding the save to csv file
